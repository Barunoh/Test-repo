  ## Part 1: Data
  # The brfss2013 data collected is a very extensive data set as it covers all of the state of the US
  # They are all observational data so that can be used for generalizational statements not causality
  # Given the size of the data set, inference can be generalized to an entire state and each state aggregated together, inference canapply to the entire country.
  # The data is beautiful gives room for multi-varriable comparison.

in the project you submit. Delete this note when before you submit your work.

**Research quesion 1:**
  
  ```{r}
plot(brfss2013 %>% 
       filter(!is.na(medcost), X_state=="Alaska") %>% 
       select(medcost), main="Medical costs too high?"
     )

```



**Research quesion 2:**
  
  ```{r}

       select(smokday2), main="Frequency days now smoking"
     )

```



**Research quesion 3:**
  
  ```{r}
plot(brfss2013 %>% 
       filter(X_state=="Delaware") %>% 
       select(hlthpln1), main="Does have health plan?"
